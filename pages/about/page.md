# About Consulting for Normal People

<p class="lead">We're product leaders who got tired of watching consultants overcomplicate simple problems and overcharge for slide decks.</p>

## Our Story

CFNP started after one too many conversations that went like this:

**Founder**: "We need help figuring out our product roadmap."

**Typical Consultant**: "Great! Let's do a six-month engagement. We'll start with stakeholder interviews, create a comprehensive framework, align on strategic pillars..."

**Founder**: "We just need someone to help us decide what to build next quarter."

**Typical Consultant**: "That'll be $200,000."

We knew there had to be a better way. Consulting doesn't have to mean months of discovery sessions and decks full of buzzwords. Sometimes you just need an experienced person to sit down with your team, understand the problem, and help you move forward.

That's what we do.

## Who We Are

We're a small team of product leaders who've built and scaled products at companies from early-stage startups to public tech companies. We've been VPs of Product, Chief Product Officers, and founding PMs. We've made the mistakes, learned the lessons, and figured out what actually works.

### What Makes Us Different

**We've done the job.** We're not career consultants. We're product leaders who consult because we genuinely enjoy helping teams succeed. We've sat in your chair, dealt with your constraints, and navigated the same challenges.

**We charge fairly.** Our pricing is transparent and reasonable. We're not trying to maximize billable hours or upsell you into yearlong retainers. We want to help, get paid fairly for our time, and move on when the work is done.

**We tell the truth.** If we can't help, we'll say so. If your plan won't work, we'll tell you why. If you don't need a consultant, we'll be the first to admit it.

## Our Approach

We don't have a proprietary framework or a seven-step process. Every company is different, every challenge is unique, and cookie-cutter solutions rarely work.

Instead, we:

1. **Listen first.** We spend time understanding your business, your team, and your constraints before offering solutions.

2. **Get specific.** We focus on your actual problems, not theoretical best practices that don't apply to your situation.

3. **Work alongside you.** We don't disappear into a conference room and emerge with a deck. We collaborate with your team and share what we're thinking as we go.

4. **Leave you stronger.** Our goal isn't to make you dependent on consultants. It's to help you build the capabilities to solve these problems yourself next time.

## Let's Talk

Want to work with consultants who actually understand what you're going through?

Tell us about your challenge. If we think we can help, we'll tell you how. If we don't think we're a good fit, we'll tell you that too (and probably suggest someone who is).
