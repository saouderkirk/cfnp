# About Consulting for Normal People

<p class="lead">We're a trio of practitioners—product leadership, behavioral research, engineering—who got tired of watching consultants overcomplicate simple problems and overcharge for slide decks.</p>

## Our Story

CFNP started after one too many conversations that went like this:

**Founder**: "We need help figuring out our product roadmap."

**Typical Consultant**: "Great! Let's do a six-month engagement. We'll start with stakeholder interviews, create a comprehensive framework, align on strategic pillars..."

**Founder**: "We just need someone to help us decide what to build next quarter."

**Typical Consultant**: "That'll be $200,000."

We knew there had to be a better way. Consulting doesn't have to mean months of discovery sessions and decks full of buzzwords. Sometimes you just need experienced people who can discover the truth, set the direction, and—if needed—build the first version with you.

That's what we do. And we do it as a team.

## Who We Are

We're a trio of practitioners who've done the job, not theorists selling frameworks. We've built products, scaled teams, run research, and shipped code at companies from early-stage startups to public tech companies.

### What Makes Us Different

**We're the rare combination.** No other boutique consultancy offers product strategy + scientific research + engineering execution in one team. Most firms give you slide decks. We give you insight, direction, and working prototypes.

**We've done the job.** We're not career consultants. We're practitioners who consult because we genuinely enjoy helping teams succeed. We've sat in your chair, dealt with your constraints, and navigated the same challenges.

**We de-risk your executive hires.** Most companies hire a VP into a broken system, then wonder why it doesn't work. We fix the systematic problems first—building vision, strategy, OKRs, and cross-functional alignment with your existing team. Then hiring into that role becomes much less risky (or unnecessary).

**We charge fairly.** Our pricing is transparent and reasonable. We're not trying to maximize billable hours or upsell you into yearlong retainers. We want to help, get paid fairly for our time, and move on when the work is done.

**We tell the truth.** If we can't help, we'll say so. If your plan won't work, we'll tell you why. If you don't need a consultant, we'll be the first to admit it.

## Our Approach

We don't have a proprietary framework or a seven-step process. Every company is different, every challenge is unique, and cookie-cutter solutions rarely work.

Instead, we:

1. **Listen first.** We spend time understanding your business, your team, and your constraints before offering solutions.

2. **Get specific.** We focus on your actual problems, not theoretical best practices that don't apply to your situation.

3. **Treat your org like a product.** We do discovery with your ICs and managers (the "customers"), understand what's actually broken, and build solutions WITH your team—not just for them. We're not gurus who disappear and come back with answers. We work alongside you.

4. **Leave you stronger.** Our goal isn't to make you dependent on consultants. It's to help you build the capabilities to solve these problems yourself next time.

## Let's Talk

Want to work with consultants who actually understand what you're going through?

<a href="mailto:hello@consultingfornormalpeople.com" class="cta">Get in Touch</a>

Tell us about your challenge. If we think we can help, we'll tell you how. If we don't think we're a good fit, we'll tell you that too (and probably suggest someone who is).
