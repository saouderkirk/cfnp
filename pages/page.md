## What We Do

Helpful, human, sensibly priced product advising and leadership has become challenging to find. We fix that.

### Strategic Guidance
Real results from real professionals with real experience. Not every firm needs a full-time Chief Product Officer, and not every leadership team sees hundreds of thousands of dollars of value in a slide deck.

We help you figure out what to build, why it matters, and how to get there. No frameworks for framework's sake. No all-hands decks that say nothing. Just clear thinking and practical advice that moves your business forward.

### Execution Support
We roll up our sleeves and work alongside your team. No hand-waving, no disappearing after the presentation. We help you get things done.

Whether you need someone to unblock a stuck initiative, coach a growing product team, or just be an extra pair of hands for a critical quarter, we're in it with you. We integrate with your team, not lecture from the sidelines.

### Plain Talk
We speak human, not consultant. Transparent pricing, honest assessments, and actionable advice. No jargon, no BS.

You'll never hear us talk about "synergy" or "leveraging core competencies." We say what we mean. If something's not working, we'll tell you. If we don't know, we'll tell you that too.

## Who We Work With

We work with tech companies (100-5000 employees) facing their first major scaling challenges:

- **Your startup processes are breaking** - What worked for 7 people doesn't work for 70 or 700
- **You need structure, not more chaos** - Vision, strategy, OKRs, cross-functional alignment across teams
- **Hiring an exec is risky and expensive** - A bad VP hire costs you 12 months and hundreds of thousands of dollars
- **Big consultancies deliver slide decks, not results** - You need embedded solutions, not theoretical frameworks

We help you build the systems you need to scale, then make your executive hires into functioning organizations—not broken ones.

## How We Work

**Engagements are flexible.** We can work as advisors (a few hours a week), embedded team members (part-time or full-time), or on specific projects with defined outcomes.

**Pricing is transparent.** No retainer games, no scope creep surprises. You'll know what things cost before we start.

**Success is measurable.** We define clear outcomes at the beginning. If we're not adding value, we'll be the first to say it.
