## What We Do

You don't need another consultant telling you what you already know. You need a team that discovers the truth, sets the direction, and—if needed—builds the first version with you.

### Insight & Discovery
**Behavioral research that actually informs decisions.**

We don't just run interviews and write summaries. We design research that's rigorous, replicable, and rooted in behavioral science. Customer segmentation, survey design, decision-grade insights—all delivered by a PhD clinical psychologist who's advised multiple startups on discovery practice.

Most teams guess what their customers want. We help you know.

### Strategy & Scaling
**Product leadership without the executive hire.**

Vision, roadmap, OKRs, cross-functional alignment—all the things that break when you go from 7 people to 70 or 700. We slot in as fractional product leadership, fix the systematic problems, and build the structures you need to scale.

Then hiring a VP becomes much less risky (or unnecessary).

### Execution & Prototyping
**Engineering that moves as fast as you think.**

Rapid prototypes, MVPs, internal tools, architecture reviews—we build what you need to validate ideas, unblock teams, or automate workflows. Full-stack engineering led by someone who's invented frameworks and shipped products.

Strategy is worthless if you can't execute. We do both.

## The Team

We're a trio of practitioners who've done the job, not theorists selling frameworks.

**Product Leadership & Scaling** — Simon brings GM-style product leadership, org design, and fractional CPO work. He's scaled teams from startup chaos to functioning product organizations.

**Behavioral Research & Insight** — Our PhD clinical psychologist designs rigorous discovery systems, customer segmentation, and survey methodology. Multiple startups rely on their expertise to truly understand users.

**Engineering & Prototyping** — Kris is a full-stack engineer who's invented frameworks (Kixx), built products, and knows how to turn strategy into working code fast.

Together, we're the rare combination of insight, strategy, and execution that most consultancies can't offer.

## Who We Work With

We work with tech companies (100-5000 employees) hitting the "everything is breaking" moment:

- **Your startup processes don't scale** - What worked for 7 people fails at 70 or 700
- **You're guessing what customers want** - Interviews are messy, surveys are broken, and you need real insight
- **Hiring a VP is risky and expensive** - A bad executive hire costs 12 months and hundreds of thousands of dollars
- **You need to build fast, not just strategize** - MVPs, prototypes, and internal tools that move at the speed of decisions
- **Big consultancies deliver slide decks, not results** - You need people who can discover, decide, and build with you

We're the trio that gives you insight, strategy, and execution—without the corporate theater.

## How We Work

**Engagements are flexible.** We can work as advisors (a few hours a week), embedded team members (part-time or full-time), or on specific projects with defined outcomes.

**Pricing is transparent.** No retainer games, no scope creep surprises. You'll know what things cost before we start.

**Success is measurable.** We define clear outcomes at the beginning. If we're not adding value, we'll be the first to say it.
